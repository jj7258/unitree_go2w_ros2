# Switch gait for Go2W (wheeled version)
# Use /mode, /stand_up, /stand_down, /balance_stand services to change robot state first
# Then use this service to switch between locomotion gaits (0-3)
#
# Note: Negative values (-3, -2, -1) are STATUS values reported in /api/sport/response
#       They are NOT commandable via this service
#
# Status values (read-only from /api/sport/response "gait" field):
#   -3 = Damping mode
#   -2 = Prone with locked joints  
#   -1 = Transitioning/Unknown

# Commandable gait values (valid for this service):
int32 MOVE = 0                  # Normal locomotion mode
int32 TERRAIN = 1               # Terrain mode
int32 CLIMB = 2                 # Climb mode
# Note: Handstand uses separate API (1039), use /mode handstand instead
